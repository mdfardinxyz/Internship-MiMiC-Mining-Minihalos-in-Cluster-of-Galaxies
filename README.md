## MiMiC: Mining Minihalos in Cluster of Galaxies

### Merit Internship in Data-intensive Astronomy (MerIDiAn)

### Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing specific features within galaxy clusters through the production of brightness temperature maps, entropy maps, and radial profiles. The objective is to identify and interpret layers of patterns across different regions of the clusters. By mapping these properties, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the thermal and dynamical structures within the clusters. The data analysis involves examining variations in temperature, entropy, and other radial characteristics to discern underlying physical processes affecting the cluster's behavior. Utilizing the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) software, we process X-ray data to enhance our analysis, providing detailed insights into the clusterâ€™s X-ray emissions and physical properties. This foundational work sets the stage for future investigations into phenomena such as the distribution of gases, potential magnetic field influences, and the dynamical state of the clusters.
